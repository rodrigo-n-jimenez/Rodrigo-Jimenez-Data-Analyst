## About me
Hi, I'm Rodrigo! I have a strong background in logistics, supply chain management, and process automation, with over a decade of experience implementing data-driven solutions. 
Throughout my career, I have successfully standardized reporting for global logistics partners, developed dashboards and KPIs, simplified tasks through automation, and improved cost transparency by reconciling freight invoices. I thrive on leveraging data analytics, automation, and process optimization to drive operational excellence and strategic decision-making.
I am always eager to explore new tools and methodologies in data analysis, continuously seeking opportunities to deepen my expertise and broaden my technical skill set. 
Whether working independently or in a team setting, I am motivated by the challenge of uncovering meaningful insights and applying data-driven solutions to solve intricate problems.
